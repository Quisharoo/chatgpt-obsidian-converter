In ESM contexts __dirname is undefined, so running vite for dev or build will crash immediately with ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined. Compute the directory using import.meta.url (e.g., fileURLToPath) or switch back to a CommonJS config before relying on __dirname. Useful? React with üëç / üëé.",

          "body_text": "PR Code Suggestions ‚ú® Explore these optional code suggestions: CategorySuggestion ImpactHigh-level PR introduces two conflicting implementations **The PR creates two conflicting UI implementations: a refactored vanilla JS orchestrator using new service classes, and a new React app with its own logic. Since only the React app is mounted, the entire refactored orchestrator and its services are unused, resulting in significant dead code.** Examples: src/main.js [6-21] src/modules/applicationOrchestrator.js [22-97] Solution Walkthrough: Before: After: Suggestion importance[1-10]: 10 __ Why: This is a critical architectural issue, as the PR introduces a large amount of dead code by creating two parallel, conflicting implementations while only one (React) is actually used.High Possible issue Fix memory leak in toast component **Reduce the TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY from 1000000 to a reasonable value like 1000 to fix a memory leak where dismissed toasts are not removed from memory.** [src/components/hooks/use-toast.js [6-13]](github.com) [ ] **Apply / Chat** Suggestion importance[1-10]: 8 __ Why: The suggestion correctly identifies a significant memory leak caused by an extremely long toast removal delay and proposes a simple, effective fix that is critical for application stability.Medium Ensure file download is not interrupted **Delay the cleanup of the download link and object URL using setTimeout to prevent interrupting the file download process in some browsers.** [src/reactApp/useConverter.js [236-244]](github.com) [ ] **Apply / Chat** Suggestion importance[1-10]: 7 __ Why: The suggestion addresses a known browser compatibility issue where immediate DOM cleanup can interrupt file downloads, and the proposed setTimeout is a standard and effective solution.Medium Fix redundant pagination control buttons **Improve the pagination logic to conditionally show the 'First' and 'Last' buttons only when the current page range does not already include the first or last page, respectively.** [src/modules/ui/resultsView.js [229-260]](github.com) [ ] **Apply / Chat** Suggestion importance[1-10]: 6 __ Why: The suggestion correctly identifies a minor UI bug in the new pagination logic and provides a valid fix, improving the user experience by preventing redundant buttons.Low Prevent resource leaks during cleanup **Centralize the dialog cleanup logic to remove the keydown event listener and clear the setTimeout timer, preventing potential resource leaks.** [src/modules/ui/dialogService.js [133-163]](github.com) [ ] **Apply / Chat** Suggestion importance[1-10]: 6 __ Why: The suggestion correctly identifies a resource leak where event listeners and timers are not consistently removed, and the proposed fix robustly centralizes the cleanup logic.Low General Use classList for safer styling **Refactor the updateSortIndicators method to consistently use classList.add and classList.remove for manipulating CSS classes, avoiding direct className assignment.** [src/modules/ui/resultsView.js [371-392]](github.com) [ ] **Apply / Chat** Suggestion importance[1-10]: 4 __ Why: The suggestion improves code consistency and robustness by advocating for classList usage over direct className assignment, which is a good practice for maintainability.Low [ ] Update",
